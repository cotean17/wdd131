                    <h2>About Me!</h2>
                    <p>I'm very glad you stopped by! My name is María José but go by Cote.</p>
                    <p>
                        Photography has been something I have really enjoyed since before I can remember. 
                        When I was in my country, Chile, I took a photography course in 2017 and after that 
                        course I began studying however I could. I also enjoy landscape and light painting 
                        photography so much but just as a hobby. 
                    </p>
                    <p>My goal is create with you and help you, especially women to feel confident, 
                        empowered and to be able to be yourself in front of the camera.
                    </p>
                    <p> Besided doing photography I love spending time with my family. 
                        I'm married to my lovely sweet husband and we have our sweet baby girl</p>
                    <p>I enjoy getting to know different love stories and you literally 
                        don't need any excuse to capture a time of your life with the ones 
                        you love. So let's get in touch!
